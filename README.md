## CAR PRICE PREDICTION
## Overview
This project aims to predict the price of a car based on various features such as brand, model, year, mileage, fuel type, and more. Using machine learning techniques, the model analyzes historical data and provides accurate price estimates for used cars.
## Features
•	Data preprocessing and cleaning

•	Feature selection and engineering

•	Model training using machine learning algorithms

•	Performance evaluation and visualization
## Technologies Used
•	Python

•	Pandas, NumPy

•	Scikit-learn

•	Matplotlib, Seaborn

•	Google Colab
## Dataset
The dataset consists of various attributes that influence car prices, such as:
•	Brand

•	Model

•	Year

•	Mileage

•	Fuel Type

•	Transmission Type

•	Engine Capacity

•	Price (Target Variable)

## Model Evaluation
The project evaluates different machine learning models to find the best-performing one. The evaluation metrics include:
•	Mean Absolute Error (MAE)

•	Mean Squared Error (MSE)

•	R-squared Score (R²)
## Future Enhancements
•	Integrate deep learning models for better accuracy

•	Deploy the model using Flask or FastAPI

•	Create a web-based interface for user interaction
